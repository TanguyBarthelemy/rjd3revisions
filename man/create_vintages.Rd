\arguments{
\item{x}{a formatted object containing the input. It can be of type
`data.frame`, `matrix` or `mts` and must represent one of the multiple
vintage views (selected by the argument `type`.}

\item{type}{character specifying the type of representation of the input
between `"long"`, `"horizontal"` and `"vertical"` approach.}

\item{periodicity}{periodicity of the time period (12, 4 or 1 for resp.
monthly,quarterly or annual data)}

\item{date_format}{character string corresponding to the format used in
the input data.frame for the revision dates.}

an object of class `rjd3rev_vintages` which contains the four
different view of a revision

\description{
Create vintage tables from data.frame, matrix or mts object in R
}
\details{
From the input data.frame, the function displays vintages considering three
different data structures or views: vertical, horizontal and diagonal. See
the `details` section below for more information on the different views. The
function returns an object of class `rjd3rev_vintages` that can be used as
input in the main function `revision_analysis`.

The are four different vintage views:

1. The vertical view shows the observed values at each time period by the
different vintages. This approach is robust to changes of base year and
data redefinition. A drawback of this approach is that for comparing the
same historical series for different vintages, we need to look at the
smallest common number of observations and consequently the number of
observations is in some circumstances very small. Moreover, it is often the
the case that most of the revision is about the last few points of the
series so that the number of observations is too small to test anything.

2. The horizontal view shows the observed values of the different vintages
by the period. A quick analysis can be performed by rows in order to see
how for the same data point (e.g. 2023Q1), figures are first estimated,
then forecasted and finally revised. The main findings are usually obvious:
in most cases the variance decreases, namely data converge towards the
'true value'. Horizontal tables are just a transpose of vertical tables and
are not used in the tests in `revision_analysis`.

3. The diagonal view shows subsequent releases of a given time period,
without regard for the date of publication. The advantage of the diagonal
approach is that it gives a way to analyse the trade between the timing of
the release and the accuracy of the published figures. It is particularly
informative when regular estimation intervals exist for the data under
study. However, this approach requires to be particularly vigilant in case
there is a change in base year or data redefinition.

4. The long view is a representation of data that allows information to be
grouped together in order to facilitate their manipulation. With 3 columns
(1 column for the time period, 1 column for the publication / revision date
and one column for the data), this representation allows for efficient and
non-redundant storage of data.

                              rep("2022-09-30",4), rep("2022-10-31",4),

                 time_period = c(rep(c("2022Q1","2022Q2","2022Q3","2022Q4"),8)),

vintages <- create_vintages(x = df, type = "long", periodicity = 4L)

## specifying the format of revision dates
vintages <- create_vintages(
    x = df,
    type ="long",
    periodicity = 4L,
    date_format= "\%Y-\%m-\%d"
)
